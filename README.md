# Gomoku with Monte Carlo Tree Search

The base game engine is from [here](https://github.com/HackerSir/PygameTutorials/tree/master/Lesson04/Gomoku). 


## The Game
Gomoku is a popular game played on the Go board, following much simpler rules. 

- There are two players, one placing black pieces and the other white pieces, at the grid intersections of the board. 
- The two players take turns to place one piece each time. Pieces are never moved or removed from the board. 
- The players' goal is to have five pieces of their own color to form an unbroken line horizontally, vertically, . Of course, these are unlikely realistic games between reasonable players.
- The game engine starts with human against a random-play agent. Click any grid intersections and see what the computer does. Press enter to see a random game between two random-play agents (also press enter to pause autoplay and switch back to human vs random). Press 'm' to switch to manually playing both sides.  


## Usage
